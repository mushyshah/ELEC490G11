  "readme": "## View Helpers\n\nThis module is used as express middleware and it provides helper methods to the views.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\n$ npm install view-helpers\n```\n\nor specify in package.json as dependency\n\n## Usage\n\nwith express\n\n```js\nvar helpers = require('view-helpers')\napp.use(helpers('app name')) // make sure you declare this middleware after `connect-flash` and `express.session` middlewares and before `express.router`.\n```\n\nIn your views you would have access to some methods and variables. The middleware also exposes `req` object.\n\n### API\n\n* `createPagination(pages, page)` - creates pagination\n* `formatDate(date)` - date is a mongoose `Date` object\n* `isActive('/link/href/')` - to add active class to the link\n* `stripScript(str)` - to escape javascript inputs\n* `req.isMobile` - detects if the request is coming from tablet/mobile device\n* `res.render('template', locals, cb)` - mobile templates - If the request is coming from a mobile device, then it would try to look for a `template.mobile.jade` (or with the registered extension, it can also be ejs, hbs etc) file in the views folder and render it. This has been added in the 0.1.0 version.
